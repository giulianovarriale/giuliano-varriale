# Hello, I am Giuliano Varriale, an experienced frontend developer that loves to build great user experiences.

I’m a software developer specialised in frontend development with over 14 years of experience. While I’ve spent most of my time building UIs, I consider myself a T-shaped developer, capable of transitioning to backend work whenever it’s needed. Crafting digital products is what truly makes me happy—frontend and backend are just part of the process to make it happen. I believe this passion for craftsmanship comes from my mother, an extraordinary handcraft artist who taught me the value of dedication and attention to detail.

For over a decade, I’ve helped companies to implement pixel-perfect designs and high-quality user interfaces. I balance speed with quality, defining the right scope to deliver value through small iterations. I believe this is the best way to deliver a great product within a reasonable timeframe. This approach also allows for early validation with real users, enabling quick adjustments or pivots if needed.

Regarding the tech stack, I primarily work with TypeScript, React, and Next.js—technologies I use daily and am highly proficient in. I appreciate how React is evolving to be more opinionated, especially with its shift towards a server-side-first paradigm, making full-stack development easier and more efficient. While I enjoy working with cutting-edge technologies, I see them as tools to achieve a goal, meaning there’s need to be a good reason to use them. I stay informed about new technologies to ensure I have suitable options to address the day to day challenges.

After years in the corporate world, I have decided to become a freelancer. I realized that building software is what truly brings me joy, so I’ve optimized my time around that. I’m a strong advocate of asynchronous communication and believe that most meetings—especially recurring ones—can be replaced with better planning and communication tools.
