# Hello, I am Giuliano Varriale, an experienced frontend developer who loves the art of crafting digital products.

I'm a software developer specialized in frontend with over 14 years of experience. I'm a T-shaped developer, being able to transition to backend when needed.

For over a decade, I've helped companies to implement pixel-perfect, accessible and performant user interfaces. I balance speed with quality, carefully defining the right scope to ensure each iteration delivers value without compromising quality.

Regarding the tech stack, besides the good old HTML, CSS and JS, I primarily work with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS and Next.js. Those are the technologies I use on my daily basis and I am highly proficient in. I stay up to date with new technologies to ensure I choose the best solutions for everyday challenges.

I'm a strong advocate of asynchronous communication and believe that most meetings can be replaced with well-structured documentation and async communication tools.

I'm currently open to new opportunities as a freelancer. If you're looking for an experienced frontend developer to help you build a new product or to improve an existing one, feel free to reach out to me at [giuliano.oca@gmail.com](mailto:giuliano.oca@gmail.com).
